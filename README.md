# Angular Custom Select
An Angular project to practice certain functionalities of the framework and to showcase my development approach.
This custom input is a simple text input but with "steroids" to transform it into a select.

This was designed for desktop, as I have tried to add keyboard control.

## Features

- The custom input text, to practice Angular Value Accessor
- Some signal variables and their management, to practice this Angular feature
- Componentization of the custom select design
- Some simple Directives, for better and clean code
